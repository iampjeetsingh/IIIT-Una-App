# Results Feature

The Results feature is a core component of our app that allows users to view and analyze their performance over time. With this feature, users can easily see how they've progressed over time, identify areas for improvement, and track their goals.

## How it Works

The Results feature works by fetching data from the APIs and generating visualizations that show their progress. Users can filter their results by semester.
